1. Generate certs on device via RSA
	`openssl genrsa -out key.pe`
	`openssl rsa -in key.pem -out key.pub -pubout`
2. Register user in http(s)://HOST/register.html
	Add device Public Key `key.pub` on register page via base64 format
	`cat key.pub| base64`
3. Loggin by username/password
	### user is connected to topic which is name is hash of password
	### user will get 5 Cookies (username,topic name, ownPrivateKey and public Key and device public key.
4. When message arrive to mosquitto we have to use device privte key to decrypt after 2 time base64 decoding.
	`echo "$message"| base64 -d | base64 -d |  openssl pkeyutl -decrypt -inkey key.pem`
5. When device publish message to same topic need to be encrypted with user public key.
	`echo "$message"| openssl pkeyutl -encrypt -pubin -inkey $user.pub| base64`
